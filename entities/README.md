# entities.json specification

[`entities.json`](../entities.json) is a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) file containing information about sleep-related entities.  This document explains the format of that file.

The project itself builds [`entities.json`](../entities.json) from files hosted in the same directory as this specification.  Their format is typically similar enough that an interested developer can learn a lot from the specification, but no guarantees are made about them - even that they will continue to exist in future.  Production systems should avoid them in favour of [`entities.json`](../entities.json) itself.

## Common features

All versions of [`entities.json`](../entities.json) contain a single root object with a `format` key that uniquely identifies the file format.  The associated value MUST begin with `https://zeitdex.github.io/resources/entities#`, followed by an arbitrary string.  All versions of the format so far use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), but implementations should not depend on this behaviour.  Instead, implementations that handle more than one version should check the format string against a list of known values.

## Version 0.0.2

Format string: `https://zeitdex.github.io/resources/entities#version-002`

Contains the following top-level sections:

- `valid_values` - lists of values that are allowed for certain keys
- `specialist` - doctors and researchers that examine sleep
- `software` - programs to process sleep data

### `valid_values`

This object contains a set of key/value pairs, where each key indicates the name of a key that can exist elsewhere in the document, and each value is an object describing valid values for that key.  Depending on the key, valid values might be either a single string or an array of strings from the list.

The following example says that all `specialist_type` keys outside of `valid_values` must have a string value matching either `physician` or `researcher`.  It further includes a non-normative English description for what those keys mean.

```json
{
 ...
 "specialist_type": {
   "physician": "a medical doctor who treats sleep disorders",
   "researcher": "an academic who studies sleep disorders"
 }
 ...
}
```

### `specialist`

This object contains a single `records` key, the value of which is a list of known specialists.  Each entry in the list is an object with the following keys:

### `modifiers`

Each entry in the `modifiers` array contains a way that a component can be modified.  Each entry is an object containing the following values:

### sort keys

Some values are hard to sort correctly.  For example, most algorithms will not sort the list `[ "6am", "noon", "10pm" ]` in a useful order.  Sort keys are objects that resemble the following:

```json
{
  "key": "012345",
  "value": "hard-to-sort-string"
}
```

`key` is a string to sort on.  Some sort keys only contains digits, but should not be converted to integers because the leading `0`s are significant.

`value` is a value to display.

## Version 0.0.1

This version is the same as `0.0.2`, except for the following:

- the format string was `https://zeitdex.github.io/resources/entities#version-001`
- the `software` section had not been documented yet, and had some minor differences
- the `forms` and `reports` sections did not support `modifiers`
